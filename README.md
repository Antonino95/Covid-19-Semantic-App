[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/09e277a338b743c698269112489c8aeb)](https://www.codacy.com/app/ieuan.walker007/Semantic-Web-Book-Search-Application?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=IeuanWalker/Semantic-Web-Book-Search-Application&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is a Project from University where i created a web application that sources data using semantic web technologies.

The objective of this assignment is to design and develop a java-based application and semantic web technologies. 

_“It enables data to be linked from a source to any other source and to be understood by computers so that they can perform increasingly sophisticated tasks on our behalf.”_

By using semantic approach it means all the information that I will store and display will be from another source 

My project is to create a data covid-19 searching application that allows users to navigate easily to find out more information about a specific data or trend. The java application will have 3 separate pages these are user search interface, an individual search data page (Data details), an individual search trends page (Trend details) and an individual search categories page (Comparison details) . The user will be able to navigate to any of these pages from one another. 

Here is a link to a video demo -
